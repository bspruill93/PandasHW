Majority of Gamers are in the Age range of 20-24 and they also spent the most in purchases.

It makes sense why the youngest age range of less than 10 spent little money because they do not have income as well the oldest spent lil money as well because they do not play games as much.

Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm	seems to be the most sought after item as well.
